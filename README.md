TODO:

- Start creation of new TRE laying out foundations for new professions.   

This time all profs will be in custom trees / branches as opposed to overwriting existing branches, all original Pre-CU profs will remain intact, untrainable and invisible to players.

Primary Professions:
-combat_jedi
-combat_soldier
-combat_shocktrooper
-combat_commando_new
-combat_assassin
-combat_medic
-combat_officer

Secondary Professions:
-secondary_bountyhunter
-secondary_entertainer
-secondary_scoundrel
-secondary_beastmaster
-secondary_ranger

Crafting Professions:
-crafting_pharmacist   (added along side of existing crafting professions, pharmacist will have equivalent requirements as any elite crafting prof)

The remainder of crafting profs remain the same, to prevent any anomalies that occured last build when we attempted to merge them.
